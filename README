protoplay
=========

Just a simple program to verify that protobuf-c makes copies of the data that
it parses and doesn't point back into the original buffer. The program proves
that and thus you can free() the buffer and use the unpacked proto structures
independently.

Requirements
============

 * protoc
 * protobuf-c
 * PALM (python)

Using It
========

    make validate
